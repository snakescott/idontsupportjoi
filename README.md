analysis of data surrounding Joi Ito and the media lab

## Context

I was surprised and confused to read about [Joi Ito](https://joi.ito.com/), Jeffrey Epstein, and the MIT Media Lab. The website [wesupportjoi.org](https://wesupportjoi.org) went online in late August (`whois` shows a domain registration date of 2019-08-26T03:33:03Z). I found the petition's support of Joi to be overly simplistic and full throated, with little thought given to systemic injustice.

> The change that is needed must be inclusive, evidence-based, and constructive, and the work towards this should start immediately under Joi’s direction. To this end, we the undersigned, attest not only to Joi’s talent in managing one of the most complex and multidisciplinary research organizations in the world, but also, and more importantly, to his character: thoughtful, humble, principled, and generous. 

Especially in light of Ronan Farrow's New Yorker [article](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-an-elite-university-research-center-concealed-its-relationship-with-jeffrey-epstein) and Ito's subsequent [resignation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/business/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joichi-ito.html), I wanted to understand better the signatories of the wesupportjoi petition.
